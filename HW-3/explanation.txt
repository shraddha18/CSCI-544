Features List

The ones that worked(or at least seem to work):
1. Count of the number of punctuation for every line
2. Count of " 's ", " 'st'" and " 'd " in the text since it has been used a lot
3. Length of the each line of text
4. Length of each line after of text removing punctuation
5. Removing stopwords
6. Counting the number of stopwords
7. Stemming each word using Snowball Stemmer
8. Count of Numbers "1" and "4" in text. Bronte has a lot of them while Shakesphere does not. Maybe due to scanning but definitely distinghushes between them

The ones that didn't quite work(or showed no particular effect):
1. Creating bigrams (no notable difference on hidden dev, decreased accuracy of visible dev)
2. Character count of the line in text (decresed accuracy)
3. Count the number of words in a line (decreased accuracy)
4. Check the spelling of the stemmed word, if it belongs to en_GB(British Dictionary) or not.(dereased accuracy)
